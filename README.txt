Hey look its a README, yea we need one now.
So with the new ssh part of the code you will need to download the professional version of pycharm. Along with that
you need to apply for the professional liscene, that can be done here: https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students
fill out that, download the professional version here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
After applying for the liscenes you will get an email that will have a link to where you can create your account to save 
your liscense. 
Once you have created your account open the professional version of pycharm, it will prompt you for your account.

(if the venv works as i want the below paragraph is not nessicary but i doubt it)
Now you should be able to use the professional version of pycharm, now you will need to add the paramiko module
to your python configuration. 
Click 'File' in the top left and select 'settings' from the drop down.
under 'project: pythongame' click on 'pyhton interprter' click the + in the bottom leftish of that window. 
in the search bar type 'paramiko' make sure the package 'paramiko'


to the left of the button you click to run the code it shows your configuration name and a dropdown arrow.
click the dropdown arrow and select edit configurations.
in the configuration area toward the bottom there is a section called execution, check the first option there called:
'emulate terminal in output console'
click apply and ok
